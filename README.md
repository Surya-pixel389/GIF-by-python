# GIF Creation Using Python

This project demonstrates how to create a GIF using Python. It's fascinating to see how we can generate dynamic visuals simply by leveraging images, loops, and variables.

## **Packages Used**
- `imageio` (imported as `iio` using the `as` keyword)

## **How It Works**
1. Provide image filenames as a list.
2. Use a `for` loop to read each image.
3. Combine them to generate a GIF file (`chicklet.gif`).

This approach allows us to create an animated image effortlessly!

So no more paid software just use the power of coding and get it for freeðŸ˜Š
